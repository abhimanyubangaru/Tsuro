# Tsuro Game 
Tsuro game made during the first semester at Case Western Reserve University


## Description 
During the spring semester of 2022 CSDS 132 Introduction to Java, I made a digital 2-player version of the classic game Tsuro. The objective of the game is to place 
tiles containing paths, and keeping your stone for as long as possible on the path. Each player has the ability to rotate their tile before placing it down. As soon 
as the tiles are placed, the stones travel across until they no longer can.
